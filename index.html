                            <p>35/14 Rashi-  In Gilaad there were many murderers.The cities of refuge were for people who killed b’Shogeg not for murderers who killed b’Meizid?
                                
                                The Ramban answers that there were many people however killed b’Meizid and pretended that they
                                 were Shogeg and therefore many people went into the cities of refuge on the pretense that they were Shogegim. Consequently the Torah gave them a lot of cities of R. Sinai of Prague, the brother of the Maharal, answers that in all regions there are a lot of people who kill b’Shogeg but not always are there witnesses who will testify that they are obligated to go to the cities of refugees. Although our sages teach us  that if two people murder and one of them is Meizid and the other is Shogeg and there are no witness to testify and have them punished  them Hashem Yisborach arranges that they end up in the same place, the person who killed Shogeg wilpl be on the top of the ladde and will fall doewn killing the person who killes Meizid who will be on the bottom of the ladder. Witnesses will testify tah the person killed b’Shogeg and each person will recived his just pusnihemmnt. Neverthless this scenario is only possible when there are an equal numb er of people who kill b’Meizid and b’Shgeg. In most places ty\he poepel who kill b’Shigegg gratly outnumeber the people who killed b’Meizid and thus it is not possible for every person who killed b’Shigeg to receive his just due and get sent into exile. Howeebr in Gillaad since there were so many murderers who killed b’Meizid there were an ewuqal number of people who killed b’Shogegetg and b’Meizid and thus it was possible that every person who killed unintentionally would get sent into Galus so it was necessary for there to be may cities of refuge.
                                 so that the people who really did kill b’Shogeg would find some room in the cities of refuge. 
                                 
                                
                                                                </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="second-p"> 
                        <p>                      
                            The Gur Aryeh doesn’t agree with this answer because this is a reason not to given them a lot of cities of refuge so that people will be reluctant to murder b’Meizid on the pretense that they are Shogeg because they may not find any room in the cities of refuge. The Gur Aryeh answers that a person who kills unintentionally is guilty of negligent; he was not at fault the Torah would not have obligated him to go into exile. Consequently in Gila’ad where human life was cheap and there were many murderers who killed deliberately there were also may people who killed unintentionally.  If they did not value human life and as a result people murdered it would stand to reason that people also killed others unintentionally out of negligence.
                            
                            Alternatively, it is the nature of certain places that has a tendency to raise murderers. Certain people have the tendency to be murderers and certain places have the tendency to raise murderers. Since these places raise murderers there will be some people who murder b’Meizid and certainly people who kill b’Shogeg.                            </p>
